# ebtel-hxr

See example-ebtel-hxr.pro for a demonstration of the reworking/streamlining of the 
codes to calculate expected HXR fluxes from EBTEL nanoflare simulations.

The code expects that you have the EBTEL code available.  EBTEL can be obtained from
https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/EBTEL.  All other needed procedures are in the PRO 
directory.

The MPFIT directory contains the files used for automated optimization of parameters. 
This is under development.
