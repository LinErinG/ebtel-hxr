# ebtel-hxr

See example-ebtel-hxr.pro for a demonstration of the reworking/streamlining of the 
codes to calculate expected HXR fluxes from EBTEL nanoflare simulations.

All needed procedures are in the PRO directory.

The MPFIT directory contains the files used for automated optimization of parameters. 
This is still under development.
